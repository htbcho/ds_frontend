Username: malsaud
Project: Density Spot

Responsible for testing accessibility, security, and compatibility.

Since our project is up on localhost, I used chrome extensions to test accessibility
and compatibility. 

- Accessibility (WAVE extension):

    Test results:
        ERRORS:
            1) Document language missing:
                The language of the document is not identified.

            2) Missing form label:
                A form control does not have a corresponding label.

            3) Missing alternative text:
                Image alternative text is not present.
        ALERTS:
            1) Possible heading:
                Text appears to be a heading but is not a heading element.

            2) Skipped heading level:
                A heading level is skipped.

    Steps taken to fix errors:

        1) Added <html lang="en"> to every HTML document.
        2) Added the following in home.html and home.css:
            <label for="search" class="visuallyhidden">Search for a study spot!</label>

            .visuallyhidden {
              border: 0;
              clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
              height: 1px;
              margin: -1px;
              overflow: hidden;
              padding: 0;
              position: absolute;
              width: 1px;
            }

        3) Added alternative text to all images in maps.html

- Compatibility (Broswer Stack Chrome Extension):

    Tested Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Chrome on Windows and Mac.
    Also tested Android, iPad Air and iPhone 6s.

    Test results:
        Chrome and Firefox on Mac and Windows: No errors.
        Microsoft Edge on Windows:
            1) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
        Android:
            1) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
            2) Sign in button too small.
        iPhone 6S:
            1) Sign in button is grey, not blue.
            2) "Brown University" is in black, not white.
        iPad Air:
            1) Sign in button is grey, not blue.
            2) "Brown University" is in black, not white.

    Steps taken to fix errors:
        1) Changed all colors to websafe color values.
            Hex color #83b8d6 -> Websafe #99cccc
            RGB color (255, 255, 255) -> Websafe #ffffff
        2) Made sign in button bigger.

- Security (SecApps)

    - All GET requests were processed successfully.

    Testing Results (Vulnerabilities):
        1) Autocomplete enabled:
            An attacker able to access the browser cache can retrieve sensible
            information in cleartext.
            PROBLEM:
                <form id="login_form" action="/auth/google">
            SOLUTION:
                Added autocomplete="off"
                <form id="login_form" autocomplete="off" action="/auth/google">

        2) Error disclosure:
            The application/server could disclose error information within its source code.
            PROBLEM:
                http://localhost:8080/auth/google/redirect?code='%3E%3CTQbBH%3E# HTTP/1.1
            SOLUTION:
                This is OAuth-related (Google's API), and is taken care of in their source code.

        3) Cross-Script Included
            The application included external scripts. Must ensure they're trusted scripts.
            PROBLEM:
                http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js
                https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js
                https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js
            SOLUTION:
                All external scripts are in fact trusted scripts and were provided by the
                instructor and TAs.
